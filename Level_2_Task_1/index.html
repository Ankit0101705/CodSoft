                India's struggle for independence against British rule. Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, he

                Bose was a visionary who believed in armed struggle to achieve independence. He formed the Indian
                National Army (INA) and allied with Axis powers during World War II to fight against British colonial
                rule. His famous slogan, "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom," inspired millions of Indians to
                join the freedom movement.
